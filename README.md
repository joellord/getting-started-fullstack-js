# Deploying Full Stack JavaScript Applications to OpenShift

OpenShift is a Kubernetes distribution by Red Hat that aims at making it easy to deploy applications. 

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to deploy a full-stack JavaScript application in an OpenShift cluster.

Starting from a source code, you will take an application that runs locally and deploy it in the [Developer Sandbox](https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox). You can find a full video of this deployment on the [DevNation Tech Talk website](https://developers.redhat.com/devnation/tech-talks/dev-sandbox).

[#devsandbox]
== Create a Developer Sandbox Account
The first step to deploy your application is to find a cluster to host it. You could use any OpenShift cluster for this demo, but if you don't have access to one, you can use the link:https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox] to have access to a free OpenShift cluster for 14 days.

To create your account, go to https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox. From there, click on the red button that says _Launch your Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift_ as shown in the following image.

Use your existing Red Hat account or create a new one, then follow the instructions on the screen. You should then be redirected to the Developer Sandbox page again, but this time, you should see a button labelled _Start using your sandbox_. Clicking on it opens up the OpenShift login screen where you can log in using the DevSandbox button, as seen below.

Clicking this button opens up your new OpenShift cluster console. Feel free to take the tour or skip it for now and continue with this workshop.

[#oc]
== Configure `oc`
To interact with your OpenShift cluster, you need the `oc` CLI tool. Thankfully, the OpenShift team made it easy for you to install it. To get the CLI tool for your operating system, click on the question mark icon at the top right of the OpenShift UI. From this dropdown, select _Command Line Tools_. This option opens up a page with the links required to install the `oc` tool.

Once the tool is installed, click on the link for _Copy Login Command_ from the same _Command Line Tools_ page. A new window will open up with the authentication screen. Select DevSandbox, then click on the _Display Tokens_ link on the next page.

On this new page, you can find a command that starts with `oc login`. Copy this whole line with the --token and --server parameters and paste it into your terminal.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc login --token=sha256~%TOKEN% --server=https://%SERVER%:6443
----

You should get a message back confirming that you successfully logged in to the developer sandbox.

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
Logged into "https://%SERVER%:6443" as "%USERNAME%" using the token provided.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

  * %USERNAME%-code
    %USERNAME%-dev
    %USERNAME%-stage

Using project "%USERNAME%-code".

[#locally]
== Run the Application Locally
The application that you will deploy to this OpenShift cluster is a URL shortener and redirection service. It has a React front-end to manage your links and connects to a Node.js API. That express server then connects to a Mongo database to store and retrieve the URLs.

The is also another application called the "redirector" micro-service that performs a database lookup and redirects the traffic to the matching URL. This service is built in PHP.

You need a copy of the source code to build your container images. To do so, you can use `git clone`.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/joellord/urlshortener
----

Feel free to explore the source code of the application. If you want to run it locally, you can do so with `docker-compose` or `podman-compose`.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

This command starts the application in development mode. To view the application, you can open up a browser and point it to http://localhost:3000.

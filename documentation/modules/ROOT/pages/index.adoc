== Publishing Full Stack JavaScript Applications to OpenShift Lab

OpenShift is a Kubernetes distribution by Red Hat that aims at making it easy to deploy applications. 

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to deploy a full-stack JavaScript application in an OpenShift cluster.

Starting from a source code, you will take an application that runs locally and deploy it in the link:https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox]. You can find a full video of this deployment at:https://developers.redhat.com/devnation/tech-talks/dev-sandbox[DevNation Tech Talk website].
